# Stock-Price-Forecasting-with-Long-Short-Term-Memory-Neural-Network
### Overview  
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in PyTorch to forecast future stock prices of Amazon (AMZN). The model learns historical trends and predicts closing prices, demonstrating the application of deep learning in financial time-series forecasting.

**Features of the Project:**
- LSTM-based architecture for sequential data modeling
- Preprocessing pipeline for stock data (scaling, windowing)
- Visualizations comparing predictions vs. actual prices

### Accessing the Project
---
Look through Stock_Forecasting_Model_with_LSTM.ipynb for a walkthrough of my code and thought process.
Download **LSTMPredictionModel.py** to run program locally. I strongly recommend this if you would like to try experiment with tuning certain parameters yourself, or to test the model on different stock datasets.  
Download **AMZN.csv** to run model against Amazon stock.  

### Skills Demonstrated
---
Skills Used: Data Preprocessing, Pytorch for Neural Network architecture, Matplotlib to generate visualization  

### Dataset Used
---
Historical Data on Amazon Closing Price was used, starting from when the company first publicly listed its stock (around 30 years ago).
